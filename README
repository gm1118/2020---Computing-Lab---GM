File Submitted:
Ball.py             (Ball class module) 
Simulation.py       (Simulation class module)
TestingScript.py    (Script containing my responses and code for all Project B Tasks except 14, which I did not complete)
ExperimentScript.py (Script for recreating data and figures used in report, although due to the randomness of the simulation, it is unlikely they can be perfectly recreated)
