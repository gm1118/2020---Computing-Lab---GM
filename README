This is the collection of code I used in the 2020 Year 2 Computing Lab at University. 
The code was intended to utilise OOP in Python to simulate a thermodynamic system using 'balls' in a container
This was my first proper experience coding a project, and the techniques used are improved upon for later projects
Please note that this testing and experiment scripts are designed for use within the Spyder IDE which amongst other attributes, uses #%% as a section break.
The rest of this file is the readme I submitted along with my code for this project's lab report



To create a Ball object:
Import Ball as B
x=B.Ball()

To create a Simulation object:
Import Simulation as S
y=S.Simulation()

File Submitted:
Ball.py             (Ball class module) 
Simulation.py       (Simulation class module)
TestingScript.py    (Script containing my responses and code for all Project B Tasks except 14, which I did not complete)
ExperimentScript.py (Script for recreating data and figures used in report, although due to the randomness of the simulation, it is unlikely they can be perfectly recreated)
